# matt-loop (Claude Code package)

The Claude Code root of the **matt loop**. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` lists `skills/` and `agents/`.

- `skills/matt-auto` — the Claude Code edition of the conductor: a fork as the decision delegate (or `matt-deep` when the session is not Fable-class), plugin agents for tickets, Workflow or `/batch` for parallel waves, `/code-review` · `/simplify` · `/security-review` for the review pass, `/loop` for PR shepherding, the Artifact tool for the decision-graph page; two gates — interview and execution plan. Continues a `/design-map` session in place.
- `skills/pr-babysit`, `skills/resolving-merge-conflicts` — Claude Code editions (plugin-agent routing, `/loop` cycle).
- `agents/` — `matt-loop:matt-default` (opus / medium) and `matt-loop:matt-deep` (fable / high); each fixes model and effort.
- The remaining skill directories are vendored from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) by `../matt-loop-codex/scripts/sync-upstream.sh` (this root skips `code-review`; the built-in `/code-review` is used instead). Do not hand-edit them.
- Requires weed-harness 5.0+ (`interview-report`, `loop-report`, `loop-gates`). Never reads `model-routing` or runs `deliver.py`.
